## David Montgomery R code for Introduction to Data Science

R code to recreate the analysis and visualization used by David H. Montgomery for several [CityLab](https://www.citylab.com) articles. 

- `traffic_deaths.R` will recreate images from the article "[What Happens When a City Tries to End Traffic Deaths](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/11/vision-zero-data-traffic-deaths-pedestrians-cyclist-safety/601831/)," by Laura Bliss, David Montgomery and Matthew Gerring. The data used for the story, tracking traffic fatalities in some of the U.S.'s largest cities, was compiled by CityLab from data provided by those cities.
    - The code here is primarily an exercise in intermediate `ggplot` techniques.

- `sotu.R` will recreate images from the article "[How Presidents from Trump to Washington Have Talked Cities in the State of the Union Address](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/02/state-of-the-union-analysis-cities-data-vis/582136/)" by David Montgomery. The data used for the story comes from the "[American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu)."  
    - The code here is an exercise in graphing, but also involves more sophisticated data-cleaning and analysis before graphing.
